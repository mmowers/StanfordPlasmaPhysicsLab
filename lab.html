              <h3>Cryopump Chamber</h3>
              This test facility consists of a non-magnetic stainless steel chamber approximately 1.5 m in diameter and 3.3 m in
              length. The chamber is pumped by a pair of two-stage cryogenic pumping systems (CVI-TM1200). The cryopumps are
              backed by a mechanical pump. In order to enhance the efficient use of this chamber, a 1.5m gate valve
              has been installed to isolate the test section from the cryopumps; in this way, the cryopumps can remain operational
               with the gate valve closed while adjustments are made in the test-section. Once any changes have been made and the
              chamber door closed, a turbo pump is used to reduce the test-section pressure. The gate valve is then opened to
              expose the cryopumps and reduce the test section to operational pressures. The pressure during typical thrust measurements
              is approximately 3×10<sup>-4</sup> Pa, measured using an ionization gauge uncorrected for Xenon.

              <h3>Diffusion Pump Chamber</h3>
              This experimental facility consists of
              a nonmagnetic stainless-steel tank approximately 1 m in diameter
              and 1.5 m in length pumped by two 50 cm diameter
              diffusion pumps and backed by a 425 L/s mechanical pump.
              The facility is equipped with several viewports and
              feedthroughs for optical and probe access to a plasma discharge.
              The base pressure of the facility with no gas flow is approximately
              10<sup>-6</sup> Torr as measured by an ionization gauge uncorrected
              for gas species. The background pressure during discharge
              operation at a xenon flow rate of 2.3 mg/s is typically
              10<sup>-4</sup> Torr.<br>

              <h3>Lil' Cryopump</h3>
              This test facility consists of a non-magnetic stainless steel chamber
              approximately 0.6 m in diameter and 1.2 m in length. The chamber is pumped by a single 50 cm diameter cryopump
              (CVI-TM500) backed by a ~60 L/s mechanical pump. The base pressure of the facility is approximately 10<sup>-4</sup> Pa, as
              measured by an ionization gauge, uncorrected for xenon. Thruster testing at xenon flow rates of 0.12-0.20 mg/s
              results in chamber background pressure of approximately 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa.

              <h3>Plasma Sprayer</h3>
              Our vacuum microplasma spray (VMPS) system has the same elements as a conventional
              VPS system, with the exception of a translation stage for either the spray torch or the substrate.
              Also, different
              from many installations, the plasma jet axis is directed downward with respect to gravity.
              <br>
              <br>
              The plasma torch is a modified Komatsu Fine Plasma
              cutting torch, with throat diameter of 1mm. Modifications include the addition of a Laval
              contour diverging section of exit-to-throat area ratio 4.5, the installation of a tungsten tip on the
              cathode, and arc operation in non-transferred mode. The nozzle has an internal powder injector
              of 1 mm diameter inclined at an angle of 30° to the horizontal and located such that its
              centerline intersects the nozzle contour 1.2 mm upstream of the exit plane.
              <br>
              <br>
              The powder feeder was designed and built in order to achieve stable average feed rates, variable
              from 0.06 g/min to 0.8 g/min using 316L stainless steel powder of 5-45 &mu;m size distribution.
              <br>
              <br>
              All gas flow rates are
              metered and measured with thermal mass flow controllers. All three independent cooling water
              loops have flow rates measured with calibrated rotameters, and the temperature rise in each
              loop is measured with a K-type thermocouple circuit using the inlet temperature as reference,
              allowing calorimetry to be performed on the three cooled regions (anode/cathode, nozzle
              diverging section, and substrate). The arc current is measured with a Hall effect current sensor.
              Arc voltage is measured with a voltmeter protected by a 20X voltage probe and a fast-acting
              rectifier circuit for shunting high-voltage spikes to ground. Process chamber pressure and
              powder feeder manifold pressure are measured with capacitance diaphragm gauges of 15 kPa
              and 150 kPa ranges, respectively. Powder feeder screw rotation rate is measured by
              tachogenerator output, which is calibrated to average feed rate for each powder prior to running
              an experiment. The stability of average powder feed rate has been tested by continuous
              sampling during deposition of powder onto a 50-gram capacity load cell. The analog signals
              from all the sensors are continuously scanned and stored digitally on a PC during an
              experiment.
