              Hybrid simulations in the radial-axial plane of an annular Hall
              Thruster, based on the model developed by J. M. Fife (MIT, 1998), are
              used to study the interior and near-field region of a Hall Thruster
              plasma. In the past, these simulations have been used to examine
              various phenomena such as channel wall erosion, background pressure,
              charge exchange collisions, heavy-particle wall interactions, and
              neutral particle injection. Also, measurements of the electron mobility
              in a laboratory Hall Thruster have permitted the study of electron
              cross-field transport through comparison of simulated discharge
              properties using experimentally-measured, Bohm-type, and classical
              mobilities. Presently, active areas of interest include the study of
              axial resistive instabilities, the use of novel propellants such as
              Bismuth and Nitrogen, and the implementation of a time-varying,
              calculated electron mobility using an empirical shear-based approach.<br>
              <br>
              <h4>Axial-Azimuthal Fluid Simulations</h4>
              A high fidelity Hall Thruster simulation has been
              formulated in the axial-azimuthal coordinate plane.This numerical model
              incorporates the dynamic continuum equations for
              the both the electrons and ions and includes the often neglected
              contributions of electron momentum and unsteady electron flow.The
              coordinate system selected for this simulation, as well as
              the inclusion of non-linear electron momentum terms, allows this model
              to self
              consistently evolve fundamental plasma oscillations in the electron and
              ion
              fields and predict non-linear wave coupling behavior.The goal of this
              research is to understand the connection
              between
              plasma oscillations and the enhanced electron mobility observed in the
              Hall
              Thruster.<br>

              Bismuth is the heaviest of all stable atomic isotopes. This property, combined with its
              relative abundance, low cost, and low ionization potential, makes bismuth a uniquely 
              efficient propellant option for plasma-based propulsion devices. The first bismuth-fueled
              Hall thrusters were developed in Russia several decades ago, and there has been renewed interest 
              in developing high powered bismuth Hall thrusters for future Nuclear Electric Propulsion
              missions to the outer planets of the solar system.<br>
              <br>
              With this new interest, and the possible development of a new bismuth-fed thruster, comes the need
              to perform diagnostics on such a thruster. To aid in the development of these diagnostics, a
              laboratory-model linear Hall thruster has been modified to run on bismuth propellant. This thruster
              provides a test bed for diagnostic development while more advanced bismuth thrusters are designed and
              developed. This thruster, along with other bismuth plasma sources developed in the Stanford Plasma
              Physics Laboratory, allows for analysis of the bismuth plasma in terms of spectroscopic emission, 
              Laser Induced Fluorescence spectroscopy, and Atomic Resonance Absorption Spectroscopy. The ultimate
              goal of these diagnostics will be the measurement of the density and velocity field of neutral and ionized
              Bismuth in the Hall thruster plume. Work in this field leverages some previous techniques used
              on xenon-fed thrusters, working to adapt those methods to the particulars of the bismuth spectrum and 
              to overcome several experimental difficulties that are unique to the bismuth propellant.<br>

              Several sources have reported a
              second mode of operation in Gas-Fed Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (GF-PPTs).
              This
              mode is accessible at high specific energies and accelerates the
              propellant
              through a thick stationary discharge region, rather than through a
              dense moving
              current sheet (snowplow). This so-called plasma deflagration mode
              provides
              significantly higher thrust efficiency and specific impulse accompanied
              by
              reduced electrode erosion. Analytical research focuses on developing a
              model that
              describes this second mode. The theoretical work is supported by
              experiments on
              our 3 kJ Coaxial High Energy (CHENG) thruster. Results show
              similarities to detonations
              and deflagrations in combustion science and inspired a model that is
              based on
              an analogy to the Rankine-Hugoniot theory from combustion theory. The
              combustion theory is extended to hydromagnetics and has shown good
              agreement
              with second mode data. In addition, it also offers new insight to the
              snowplow
              mode, suggesting that it behaves more like a plasma detonation than an
              impermeable sheet.<br>
